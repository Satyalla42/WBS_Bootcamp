    "**Sets** are another type of collections of items, just like lists and tuples. They have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They are not ordered.\n",
    "* Since they are unordered, they lack indexing.\n",
    "* They cannot contain duplicate items.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to include a duplicate in a set, it will simply not get stored.\n",

    "This characteristic makes them useful to extract unique values from other python collections. You can transform another collection into a set using the `set()` function:\n",
