Introduction
This repository includes the work completed as part of my Data Science Bootcamp at WBS. The bootcamp focuses on practical, project-based learning, covering topics such as data analysis, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project demonstrates my ability to extract insights from data, apply machine learning algorithms, and visualize data to provide actionable business solutions.

Technologies Used
Python
SQL
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Tableau
Jupyter Notebooks
Projects Overview
1. Market Analysis for Expansion
Description: Analyzed a relational database to assess whether expanding to the Brazilian market for high-end tech products is a viable decision. Key points of the analysis included market viability, delivery times, and customer service standards.
Tools: SQL, Tableau
2. Customer Segmentation for Marketing
Description: Using clustering techniques, we segmented customers based on their purchasing behaviors to develop targeted marketing strategies.
Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas
3. Sales Forecasting
Description: Built a machine learning model to predict future sales based on historical data and external factors.
Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas
Final Project
Description
My final project will involve building an end-to-end data science solution that demonstrates my ability to analyze, model, and visualize data. The project is scheduled to be completed in the next two months, and will showcase advanced techniques in machine learning, data wrangling, and presentation.
